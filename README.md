A 10min long escape room video game in VR.
Developed on Unity for HTC Vive Pro.
See the [demo video](media/VRvideo.mp4) for a complete run-through of the game.

## VR
- Haptic feedback (controller vibrations)
- physical locomotion (i.e. real-world movement)
- 3D audio 
- We engineered and implemented **flying locomotion** by wing flapping, based of fluid dynamics equations : [code](Assets⁩/Scripts/Flying&#32Exp⁩/FlyingExp.cs) and [here](⁨http://github.com/BenjBarral/VirtualReality-EscapeRoomGame/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Flying%20Exp/FlyingExp.cs)
